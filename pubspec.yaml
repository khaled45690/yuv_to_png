name: yuv_to_png
description: "This package provides a Flutter plugin to convert YUV image data into PNG image format. It includes platform-specific implementation code for Android only as this from my knowledge happens only in Android systems . 
The plugin takes in CameraImage image data in both yuv240 and nv21 and returns a PNG image in uint8list . This allows you to process camera frames, video frames etc captured natively in YUV format and convert them to PNG that can be displayed in Flutter when needed.
